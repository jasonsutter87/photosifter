## Overview

PhotoSifter is a desktop application that runs entirely on your computer. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

**The short version:** Your photos never leave your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your photos or personal data.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect
- **Your photos** - PhotoSifter processes photos locally on your device. No images are uploaded to any server.
- **Photo metadata** - EXIF data, file names, and folder structures stay on your computer.
- **Personal information** - We don't require accounts, emails, or any personal details to use the app.

### What We May Collect
- **License keys** - If you purchase a Pro license, your license key is validated locally against your purchase.
- **Crash reports** - If you opt-in, anonymous crash reports may be sent to help us improve the app.
- **Update checks** - The app may check for updates, which involves a request to our server containing only the app version.

## Third-Party Services

### LemonSqueezy (Payment Processing)
When you purchase a Pro license, payment is processed by LemonSqueezy. Their privacy policy applies to that transaction. We receive only your license key and order confirmation—not your payment details.

### No Analytics
We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any tracking services on the desktop application.

## Data Storage

All data processed by PhotoSifter remains on your local device:
- Duplicate detection hashes are computed locally
- Scan results are stored in local memory during the session
- No data is written to external servers

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there's nothing to delete or export. Your photos and data remain entirely under your control.

## Changes
