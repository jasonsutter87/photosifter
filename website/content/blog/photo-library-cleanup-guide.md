Your photo library is a mess. Photos scattered across devices, duplicates everywhere, years of memories mixed with screenshots and downloads. You've been meaning to fix it for years.

This guide walks you through a complete photo cleanup—from chaos to organized archive. Set aside a weekend and let's do this.

## Before You Start

### Gather All Your Photos

Photos hide in more places than you think:

- **Phone camera roll** — iPhone Photos, Google Photos, Samsung Gallery
- **Computer folders** — Pictures, Downloads, Desktop, Documents
- **External drives** — Old backups, travel drives
- **Cloud storage** — iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive
- **Social media** — Facebook, Instagram (download your data)
- **Email attachments** — Important photos sometimes live only in email
- **Messaging apps** — WhatsApp, iMessage saved photos

Copy everything to one master location before starting cleanup.

### Create a Working Copy

Never work on your only copy of photos. Before cleanup:

1. Copy your entire photo collection to an external drive
2. Verify the backup is complete
3. Work on the original, knowing you have a safety net

### Check Your Storage

You'll need space for the cleanup process:

- **Current library size** × 1.5 = minimum required space
- Temporary copies during organization need room
- Having more space makes the process faster

## Phase 1: Duplicate Removal

Duplicates are the biggest source of wasted space. On average, 10-20% of any photo collection is duplicates.

### Why Duplicates Happen
- Importing the same photos multiple times
- iCloud/Google Photos sync issues
- Downloading the same image repeatedly
- Backup restores merging with current library
- "Save Image" on the same photos from messaging apps

### The Right Approach

Use a tool with:
- **Hash-based detection** — Finds exact duplicates, not filename matches
- **Visual comparison** — See thumbnails before deciding
- **Manual selection** — You choose which copy to keep
- **Review folder** — Safety net before permanent deletion

PhotoSifter handles all of this:

1. Point it at your photo folders
2. Run the scan (seconds for thousands of photos)
3. Review duplicate groups side-by-side
4. Choose which copies to keep (usually the one in your organized folder)
5. Move duplicates to review folder
6. Delete when you're confident

### Expected Results

| Library Size | Typical Duplicates | Space Recovered |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 5,000 photos | 500-1,000 | 2-5 GB |
| 20,000 photos | 2,000-4,000 | 10-25 GB |
| 50,000 photos | 5,000-10,000 | 30-75 GB |

## Phase 2: Folder Organization

After removing duplicates, organize what remains.

### The Date-Based Structure

The most sustainable organization:

```
Photos/
  2024/
    01/
    02/
    03/
    ...
  2023/
    01/
    02/
    ...
```

**Why it works:**
- Every photo has a date (EXIF or file date)
- Chronological browsing makes sense
- Scales to any library size
- Works across all platforms

### Automated Organization

Tools like PhotoSifter can sort photos by date automatically:

1. Select source folders
2. Choose "Classic Mode" for date organization
3. Run—photos move to YYYY/MM structure based on EXIF dates
4. Photos without EXIF use file modification date

### Manual Subfolders (Optional)

For major events, add subfolders:

```
Photos/
  2024/
    06/
      Hawaii-Vacation/
      Sisters-Wedding/
    07/
      ...
```

Keep the date structure as the primary organization; events as secondary.

## Phase 3: Handle Problem Files

### Screenshots
Options:
- Delete them (most are temporary)
- Move to separate `Screenshots/YYYY/MM` structure
- Keep mixed with photos if you use them for memories

### Memes and Downloads
Web images, memes, and random downloads don't belong with photos:
- Create a separate `Downloads Archive` folder
- Move non-photo images there
- Or delete them entirely

### Scanned Photos
Physical photo scans have the scan date, not original date:
- Create a `Scanned-Historical` folder
- Organize by approximate decade or era
- Add date info to folder names: `Scanned/1990s-Family/`

### Videos
Videos often live with photos but can be huge:
- Keep in same date structure
- Or separate into `Videos/YYYY/MM`
- Consider archiving old videos to external storage

## Phase 4: Backup Strategy

Your organized library needs protection.

### The 3-2-1 Rule
- **3** copies of your photos
- **2** different storage types (e.g., SSD + cloud)
- **1** offsite (cloud or physically elsewhere)

### Practical Backup Setup

**Copy 1: Working Library**
- Your main organized folder on your primary computer
- What you access daily

**Copy 2: Local Backup**
- External drive, updated regularly
- Use Time Machine (Mac) or File History (Windows)
- Or manual folder sync monthly

**Copy 3: Cloud Backup**
- iCloud, Google Drive, Backblaze, etc.
- Automatic sync preferred
- Encrypted for privacy

### Verify Your Backups
Backups that don't work aren't backups:
- Quarterly: Open backup drive, verify files are accessible
- Annually: Restore a random photo from backup to confirm it works

## Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance

The cleanup is done. Keep it that way.

### Import Workflow
Establish a consistent process for new photos:

1. Import photos to a consistent location
2. Run duplicate check (catches same photos imported twice)
3. Let auto-organization move to YYYY/MM folders
4. Delete from camera/phone after confirming import

### Monthly Maintenance
10 minutes per month:
- Check Downloads folder for stray photos
- Import any new photos from devices
- Quick duplicate scan on recent folders

### Annual Deep Clean
One hour per year:
- Full duplicate scan on entire library
- Verify backup integrity
- Archive old years to external storage if needed
- Review and delete screenshots/temporary images

## Tools Summary

| Task | Recommended Tool | Alternative |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Duplicate removal | PhotoSifter | Gemini 2 (Mac) |
| Date organization | PhotoSifter | exiftool (command line) |
| Local backup | Time Machine (Mac) / File History (Win) | Manual copy |
| Cloud backup | Backblaze / iCloud / Google One | Any cloud storage |
| Photo viewing | Apple Photos / Google Photos | Any viewer |

## Cleanup Timeline

Realistic time estimates for complete cleanup:

| Library Size | Total Time |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1,000-5,000 photos | 2-4 hours |
| 5,000-20,000 photos | 4-8 hours |
| 20,000-50,000 photos | 1-2 days |
| 50,000+ photos | 2-4 days |

The automated parts (scanning, organizing) take minutes. The time is in reviewing duplicates and deciding what to keep.
